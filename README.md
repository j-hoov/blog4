These pieces are more than abstract knits on wood frames. Channing Hansen hand-knits these pieces, but he generates the instructions he follows through a Python algorithm that processes his own DNA. Inspired by the experimental art of the Fluxus community from the 1960's, Hansen is interested in quantum superposition, which is "the act of measuring particles that collapses its 'wave function' or all of the possibilities and probabilities, into one state or another." His pieces were displayed in a solo show at the Stephen Friedman Gallery in London June 8-July 29, 2017.

Memo Akten's "Simple Harmonic Motion" is composed of a series of pieces. Pictured here are excerpts of piece #14. The goal of the series is to explore "the emergence of complex behaviour through the interaction of simple multilayered rhythms." Each piece is a video of simple motion series accompanied by music. Akten means to invoke the interactions of man and machine, of chaos and order, of technology and nature. The interwoven visual and sonic components all come from a complex signal broken down into its simplest parts on different frequencies - they visualize the normally invisible mathematical processes underlying natural things around us.
